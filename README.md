This repository lists **dynamic analysis tools** for all programming languages, build tools, config files and more.  
The official website, [analysis-tools.dev](https://analysis-tools.dev/) is based on this repository and adds rankings and user comments for each tool.

## What is Dynamic Analysis?

> Dynamic program analysis is the analysis of computer software that is performed by executing programs on a real or virtual processor. â€” [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_program_analysis)
